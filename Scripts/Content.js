CoOps not only provides the set of rules and standard practices to run such projects from beginning to the end, but also equips the user with necessary tools to pro-actively search such project and assess their priority based on some defined criterion. In the bigger picture, it equips the Flight Ops Engineers with necessary tools, techniques, Web platforms, Forms and templates to smoothly conduct and complete the standardization projects without having the formal knowledge of Project Management. The application of these procedures will in turn speed up the process of standardizing the flight ops and training deliverables across all programs which will result in huge savings with respect to resource time, cost and motivation along with speedy delivery of standardized manuals to customers.",

The mentioned set of projects includes the projects related to harmonization of the Flight Operations and Training deliverables across all Airbus aircraft programs. CoOps not only provides the set of rules and standard practices to run such projects from beginning to the end, but also equips the user with necessary tools to pro-actively search such project and assess their priority based on some defined criterion. In the bigger picture, it equips the Flight Ops Engineers with necessary tools, techniques, Web platforms, Forms and templates to smoothly conduct and complete the standardization projects without having the formal knowledge of Project Management. The application of these procedures will in turn speed up the process of standardizing the flight ops and training deliverables across all programs which will result in huge savings with respect to resource time, cost and motivation along with speedy delivery of standardized manuals to customers.",
